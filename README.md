# Quiz-Maker
As I understand it. This program is meant for a user to be able to create and test their own quiz.
## User Creates A Quiz
The way that I invision this starts with creatinga loop that creates new objects called QuestionAndAnswers. These objects will contain quesion wording, a list of wrong answers
and the correct answers. Each time the user enters the loop a new QuestionAndAnswers will be created. They will fill in each field one by one as prompted by the program.
### Question Wording
This field is about as straight forward as it gets. The user is prompted to type out the question they would like to enter into their quiz. Once they type out the question,
they will be prompted to enter the next field.
### Correct Answser
This is another pretty straight forward field. Just like with question wording, the user will be prompted to type out the correct answer to this question. Once the user has
finished, they will then be prompted to fill out the next field.
### Wrong Answer List
This field is a little bit different than the last two. There will be a loop that allows the user to enter all of the wrong answers for the question. They will enter these
answers one at a time and each time when they are finished, they will be asked whether or not they would like to enter another answer. Once the user is finished, they will
be asked if they would like to create another question or not.
### Question and Answers List
These questions that the user creates, will be stored in a list to be accessed later when the user is ready to try out their quiz.
## User Tries Out Quiz
This part of the program is something I haven't figured out yet.
