# Quiz-Maker
As I understand it. This program is meant for a user to be able to create and test their own quiz.
## User Chooses An Action
User is prompted to choose between making a quiz, saving a quiz and loading a quiz.
## User Creates A Quiz
If the User chooses to make a quiz, then they are plunged into the quiz making process. They will be asked to write out the wording of the first
question. Then they will enter the right answer for the question. After this, they will make up to 9 wrong answers.
### Question Wording
The User types out the question the way they would like it printed.
### Correct Answser
The User types out the correct answer the way they would like it printed.
### Wrong Answers
The user will create up to 9 wrong answers for this question. They will be prompted, after each answer they create, to decide if they would like to
create another one.
### Question List
These questions that the user creates, will be stored in a list to be accessed later when the user is ready to try out their quiz.
## Save Quiz
Another action the User will be able to choose is to save a quiz that they have just made.
## Load Quiz
The final option for the User may select allows them to load a quiz from a file of their choosing.
## User Takes the Quiz (I do not really know how this part is going to work)
At the end of each action, the user will be prompted to decide if they would like to take the quiz that they currently have loaded into their
program or not. If they decide yes, the program will proceed to print the questions and allow the user to answer them. If the user answers
no, they will then be prompted to decide on another action or exiting the quiz.
